Guild Wars 2 Archive Documentation
==================================

This project is designed to document everything needed to know to extract and use files from the Guild Wars 2 Archive (GW2.DAT).  The document, when complete, should help facilitate the creation of better community tools for viewing models, maps, and sounds from the Archive even without access to the Internet.

The initial motivation for this project was the lack of a good preview window for armor, weapons, and dyes.  I wanted to learn everything necessary to create a better, and offline, preview program for all armors, dyes, and eventually weapons.  Unfortunately, I found that there was a significant lack of documentation on this file -- particularly on its compression.  So, being the distracted person I am, I started this project first.
